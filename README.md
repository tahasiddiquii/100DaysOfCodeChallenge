# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! This repository documents my daily coding journey as I commit to coding for 100 consecutive days. Through this challenge, I aim to enhance my coding skills, deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and work towards excelling in campus placements for product-based companies.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code Challenge is a personal commitment to code every day for 100 days. It involves dedicating time to learning, practicing, and building coding projects. During this challenge, I will primarily focus on strengthening my knowledge of data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Goals

- Master the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms.
- Solve a variety of DSA questions to improve problem-solving skills.
- Enhance coding proficiency in Python.
- Build a solid foundation for technical interviews and campus placements.

## Progress

I will regularly update the repository with my progress. Each day, I will commit my code, document my learnings, and summarize the challenges I encountered. Feel free to explore the repository to see my coding journey unfold.

## Getting Involved

I encourage you to join me on this coding journey! If you're also participating in the 100 Days of Code challenge or interested in data structures and algorithms, I welcome collaboration and contributions. You can fork this repository, make your own modifications, and share your progress as well.
